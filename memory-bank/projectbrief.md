# Project Brief: MenuMind

## 1. Project Overview

MenuMind is a web application designed to modernize the restaurant dining experience. It allows restaurant owners to digitize their menus effortlessly by scanning a physical menu card. The scanned menu is converted into a structured, editable digital format using AI. This digital menu is then made available to customers through a unique QR code.

Customers can scan the QR code to view the menu, and more importantly, interact with it through a natural language chatbot to get recommendations, filter dishes, and manage their orders.

The application will be a Progressive Web App (PWA), optimized for mobile and search engines (SEO).

## 2. Core Objectives

*   **For Restaurant Owners:**
    *   Provide a simple, fast way to digitize and manage menus.

    *   Offer AI-powered image generation for menu items without photos.
    *   Generate a shareable QR code for each menu.

*   **For Customers:**
    *   Provide a modern, interactive, and accessible menu experience.
    *   Enable powerful, natural language search and filtering of menu items (e.g., "Find me a vegetarian pasta dish under â‚¹500").
    *   Offer a seamless cart and ordering system (ordering to be planned in a later phase).
    *   Ensure a fast, responsive, and mobile-first user interface.
