# Project Progress: MenuMind

## Last Updated: 2025-06-27

## 1. What Works (Completed Milestones)

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Planning
-   **[✓] Initial Planning & Clarification:** Gathered initial requirements and clarified key technical decisions.
-   **[✓] Memory Bank Creation:** All core documentation files have been created:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
    -   `activeContext.md`
    -   `progress.md` (this file)
-   **[✓] Establish Project Directory Structure:** Created `frontend` and `backend` directories.
-   **[✓] Present Detailed Development Plan:** The plan has been formulated and documented in the memory bank.

### Phase 2: Backend Development (FastAPI)
-   **[✓] Setup FastAPI Application:** Initialized the project with `main.py` and `requirements.txt`.
-   **[✓] Design Database Schema:** Defined the schema in `memory-bank/databaseSchema.md`.
-   **[✓] Implement User Authentication:** Supabase Auth integration and dependency for all endpoints.
-   **[✓] Implement Menu Management Endpoints:** CRUD APIs for restaurants, menus, and menu items are live and protected.
-   **[✓] Implement Menu Parsing Endpoint:** `/parse-menu/` endpoint built, leveraging Azure GPT-4o with the original mobile prompt.
-   **[✓] Implement Supabase Auth Test Endpoint:** `/auth/token` endpoint allows JWT retrieval for testing (not for production use).
-   **[✓] Implement Menu Items by Menu Endpoint:** Added `GET /menu-items/menu/{menu_id}` to list all menu items for a menu.
-   **[✓] Fix Decimal Serialization:** Update endpoint for menu items now converts Decimal to float, preventing JSON serialization errors.
-   **[✓] Update Postman Collection:** Added "List Menu Items by Menu" request and description for the new endpoint; all endpoints are now documented for easy testing.
-   **[✓] Fix .env Loading:** Environment variable loading is robust; backend starts from any working directory.
-   **[✓] Vector Search Endpoint Unblocked:**  
    -   Debugged and resolved the "invalid input syntax for type json" error in the Supabase `execute_sql` function.
    -   Refactored the function to use `jsonb_agg` for dynamic SQL-to-JSON conversion, which aggregates all rows into a JSON array.
    -   Updated backend SQL to cast `embedding` to text for JSON compatibility.
    -   Confirmed all embeddings are valid float arrays.
    -   The search endpoint now returns results as expected, unblocking further backend and AI development.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Upcoming Tasks)

### Phase 2: Backend Development (cont.)
-   **[ ] Implement Image Generation Endpoint:** Build the API to interact with Google Gemini for dish image generation.
-   **[ ] Implement RAG Search Endpoint:** Build the API for natural language queries using pgvector and structured filtering.
-   **[ ] Testing & Hardening:** Add tests, error handling, and security reviews for all endpoints.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Next.js)
-   **[ ] Setup Next.js Application:** Initialize the project with required dependencies.
-   **[ ] Build Owner Authentication Pages:** Create login and sign-up forms.
-   **[ ] Build Admin Dashboard:**
    -   Menu upload and parsing interface.
    -   Menu item management (view, edit, delete).
    -   Image generation and upload interface.
-   **[ ] Build Customer-Facing Menu Page:**
    -   Display menu with categories and items.
    -   Implement the chat interface.
-   **[ ] Implement Cart Functionality:**
    -   Add to cart, view cart, update quantities.
-   **[ ] Implement PWA features.**

## 3. Known Issues & Blockers

-   Supabase project and API keys must remain configured for backend endpoints to function.
